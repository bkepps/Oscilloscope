forked from DataGrapher branch allinone

Eventually will be software for a usb oscilloscope, but it will be able to use multiple kinds of hardware interfaces (modular design?)

(I.e. it currently has support for getting data from a serial port, but if I ever get around to making some proper hardwars it'll be able to either read from that or from a serial port or both)

Currently it works, but doesn't have many features

makes use of SDL2 library for graphics
https://libsdl.org/index.php

and SDL-ttf for text
